PhishyMail AI is a machine learningâ€“powered system for detecting phishing emails. It analyzes the content and metadata of incoming emails using natural language processing. The system incorporates logistic regression and Random Forest classifiers to distinguish phishing attempts from legitimate messages, leveraging Python-based preprocessing, feature extraction, and robust evaluation metrics to ensure high detection accuracy.

## Problem Statement
With phishing attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and widespread, the need for real-time, reliable detection of these emails is more urgent than ever. This project addresses a critical cybersecurity threat by using machine learning to protect users from deceptive emails, ultimately enhancing online safety and reducing the risk of personal data breaches.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->
(UPDATE IN README.md)
Enumerate the main results of this project in a list and describe them.
*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses*
   - *When prompted about this world event*
   - *When prompted about this field of science*
   - *When prompted about this political party*
  
   
## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->
(UPDATE IN README.md)
*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
