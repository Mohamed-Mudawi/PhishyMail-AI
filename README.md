PhishyMail AI is a machine learningâ€“powered system for detecting phishing emails. It analyzes the content and metadata of incoming emails using natural language processing. The system incorporates logistic regression and Random Forest classifiers to distinguish phishing attempts from legitimate messages, leveraging Python-based preprocessing, feature extraction, and robust evaluation metrics to ensure high detection accuracy.

## Running Locally

```
- git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Mudawi/PhisyMail-AI
- python -m venv venv
- venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1 #powershell
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- streamlit run finalFrontend.py
```


## Problem Statement
With phishing attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and widespread, the need for real-time, reliable detection of these emails is more urgent than ever. This project addresses a critical cybersecurity threat by using machine learning to protect users from deceptive emails, ultimately enhancing online safety and reducing the risk of personal data breaches.

(UPDATE IN README.md)

<p>
Our phishing email detection app utilizes three different algorithms developed by different members of the team.
This section explains the methodology used for my implementation.
</p>

<h3>Data Preparation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The dataset was preprocessed and reduced to the following columns: <code>subject</code>, <code>sender</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>label</code>, and <code>urls</code>.</li>
  <li>All missing values were removed.</li>
  <li>A new column named <code>text</code> was created by joining the <code>subject</code> and <code>body</code> columns.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Text Cleaning</h3>
<p>A custom text cleaning function was implemented to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove URLs</li>
  <li>Remove email addresses</li>
  <li>Remove punctuation</li>
  <li>Convert all text to lowercase</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feature Extraction</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Applied <strong>TF-IDF Vectorization</strong> on the cleaned <code>text</code> column to convert textual data into numerical features.</li>
  <li>Counted the number of URLs in each email and stored it in a new feature called <code>url_count</code>.</li>
  <li>Normalized the <code>url_count</code> values.</li>
  <li>Combined the TF-IDF features with the normalized <code>url_count</code> feature into a single feature set.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Model Training</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Split the dataset into training and testing sets.</li>
  <li>Trained a <strong>Random Forest Classifier</strong> using the prepared features.</li>
  <li>Saved the trained model using <code>joblib</code> for later use.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deployment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Integrated the trained model into a <strong>Streamlit</strong> application to allow users to input emails and get phishing detection results in real time.</li>
  <li>The app also includes models developed by other team members for comparison and versatility.</li>
</ul>
