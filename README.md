PhishyMail AI is a machine learning–powered system for detecting phishing emails. It analyzes the content and metadata of incoming emails using natural language processing. The system incorporates logistic regression and Random Forest classifiers to distinguish phishing attempts from legitimate messages, leveraging Python-based preprocessing, feature extraction, and robust evaluation metrics to ensure high detection accuracy.

## Problem Statement
With phishing attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and widespread, the need for real-time, reliable detection of these emails is more urgent than ever. This project addresses a critical cybersecurity threat by using machine learning to protect users from deceptive emails, ultimately enhancing online safety and reducing the risk of personal data breaches.

## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->
(UPDATE IN README.md)
This project implements a phishing email detection system with three different algorithms integrated into a single Streamlit application. The section below describes the methodology followed for my model implementation.

1. Data Preparation
Initial Dataset: The dataset was preprocessed and reduced to the following key columns:
subject, sender, body, label, and urls.

Handling Missing Data: All rows containing missing values were removed to ensure model quality.

Text Consolidation: A new column named text was created by concatenating the subject and body fields.

2. Text Cleaning
A custom text-cleaning function was applied to standardize and sanitize the email content:

Removed URLs.

Removed email addresses.

Removed punctuation.

Converted all text to lowercase for uniformity.

3. Feature Extraction
TF-IDF Vectorization: Applied Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to transform the cleaned text into numerical feature vectors, capturing the importance of each term.

URL Count Feature: Counted the number of URLs in each email and stored the result in a url_count column.

Normalization: The url_count feature was normalized to match the scale of other features.

Feature Combination: Merged the TF-IDF feature matrix with the normalized url_count feature into a single feature set.

4. Model Training
Train-Test Split: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

Algorithm: A Random Forest Classifier was used to train the model due to its robustness in handling high-dimensional feature spaces.

Model Persistence: The trained model was saved using joblib for later deployment.

5. Deployment
The model was integrated into a Streamlit application, allowing users to input email data and receive predictions.

Other team members developed their own models, which were also integrated into the same Streamlit app, giving users multiple algorithm options for phishing detection.
